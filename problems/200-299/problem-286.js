/**
 * Company: VMware.
 *
 * The skyline of a city is composed of several buildings of various widths and heights, possibly
 * overlapping one another when viewed from a distance. We can represent the buildings using an
 * array of (left, right, height) tuples, which tell us where on an imaginary x-axis a building
 * begins and ends, and how tall it is. The skyline itself can be described by a list of (x, height)
 * tuples, giving the locations at which the height visible to a distant observer changes, and each
 * new height.
 *
 * Given an array of buildings as described above, create a function that returns the skyline.
