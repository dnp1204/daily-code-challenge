 * On a mysterious island there are creatures known as Quxes which come in three colors: red, green,
 * and blue. One power of the Qux is that if two of them are standing next to each other, they can
 * transform into a single creature of the third color.
 *
 * Given N Quxes standing in a line, determine the smallest number of them remaining after any possible
 * sequence of such transformations.
